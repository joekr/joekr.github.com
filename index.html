  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m adopting the motto Just Commit. I&#8217;m tired of over thinking. It makes things move slower, and can sometimes be crippling.
A good friend of my tends to tell me &#8220;just commit&#8221; when refering to code. If something breaks, fix it. If something isn&#8217;t optimal yet, it can be optimized later, but just commit. This, starting a few days ago, is my new life motto.</p>

<p>So from now now I will be just commiting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on a project that was created pre iOS 4.0, and is now only supporting iOS 4 and later. This means I am able to finally use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/00_Introduction.html">Blocks</a>. So what was being used to inform an object when a called async method passed or failed? <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSNotificationCenter</a>. This was the original code and it worked pretty well:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4422401.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>It allowed the method getSubscriptionFromServer to inform the caller in the Subscription class to know when getSubscriptionFromServer was complete, or failed. This might not have been the best way to handle this, but it doesn&#8217;t matter now.</p>

<p>Luckly I was able to make some changes, like dropping iOS 3.0 support and included the use of Blocks. This alowed me to change the above code to something like the following:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4422453.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This helped clean up the code and encapsulate a lot of what was going on. The person using the Datacontroller class no longer needed to know about the Notifications. The method signature will now tell them all they need to know inorder to call getSubscriptionFromServer.</p>

<p>While Blocks is nothing new, I was happy to be able to finally use them to help clean up the codebase.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why am I using SOAP? I don&#8217;t want to talk about it. Basically I have a need for a Spring MVC project to provide a Spring-ws SOAP endpoint.
After following the Spring documentation <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/2.0/reference/html/tutorial.html#d5e190">here</a> and downloading the source code <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/2.0/downloads/releases.html">here</a> I noticed something. The documentation is using jdom for marshalling. While the source code is using jdom2.</p>

<p>After struggling for a while I find out that using jdom, even with everything setup correctly, will result in the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;java.lang.IllegalStateException: No adapter for endpoint&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>This, I guess, is a <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SWS-782?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:changehistory-tabpanel">known issue</a>. The thing to do is use jdom2, or something else like JAXB, Castor, etc.</p>

<p>I know documentation is hard to keep up-to-date. I just thought I should put something else out on the net incause others have the same issue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a great version control system. I have used it for some time on many different projects and I really enjoy working with it. My life is bit simpler because of Git.</p>

<p>When I had to move back to <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">SVN</a> I didn&#8217;t really like the idea of losing local features branches, stashing , and easy merging. Luckily, Git has the a <a href="http://schacon.github.com/git/git-svn.html">svn command</a> which allows me to use Git as my front end to SVN.</p>

<p>What do I mean by front end? Basically, I use Git on my development machine, and use the git svn command to push/pull code from the SVN Server. Git is how I interact with SVN.</p>

<p>Why, if SVN is already being used, would you use Git? SVN is used in many code bases I have been working on lately, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t still use the advantages of Git.</p>

<p><strong>Branching and merging:</strong> I&#8217;m sure, like me, you have tasks that change quickly. On a daily basis I need to switch from working on a new feature, fixing bugs, etc. Git allows me to switch from a feature branch I&#8217;m currently working on, to a new branch for a bug/fix then merge the new branch and push upstream. Then finally get back into my larger feature branch.</p>

<p>Typically with SVN or other CVSs this is a bit more challenging. Many times I would have to say &#8220;Hold on while I get to a good stopping point&#8221;. With Git I temporarily save my changes (Stash - will talk about a bit later) and create a new branch and start working.</p>

<p><strong>Working Locally:</strong> I don&#8217;t have to comment feature code out just to make sure it is checked in. Since Git is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> I can store all my changes locally, to later be pushed to SVN when ready. This allows me to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/08/check-in-early-check-in-often.html">check in early and often</a> locally without messing up a co-worker by having crazy comment code strewn about the code base. I can make sure my feature is fully ready, and tested, before pushing upstream for all to use.</p>

<p><strong>Stashing:</strong> As mentioned before Git allows me to temporarly check in current code changes. Many times someone will point out a trivial issue in the code which needs to be in production &#8220;now&#8221;. With <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/4_stashing.html">git stash</a> I can save whatever it is I&#8217;m working on with out having to check in non-working code, again saving me time to not have to be in &#8220;a good stopping point&#8221;.</p>

<p>There are many other features Git has, these are the ones that make it a great front end for SVN. Using git svn not only saves me time, but it allows me to keep my code out of the master SVN repository until it is good and ready. I can count the number of times I have been working in newly pulled code only to find something is broken because line 23 in some file should have been commented out. Since I don&#8217;t like when others do that I choose to use Git to help make everyones lives a bit easier. What is the old saying: Do unto others as you would have them do to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was working on a Unity3D web player project that requires pulling JSON from a remote server. I needed a way to parse the JSON string. After working with multiple JSON libraries (Jayrock being the main one) I found that LitJson worked well with in Unity once you had the DLL.
I was unable to get Jayrock to work with Unity&#8217;s web player. Turns out that Unity desktop builds use a subset of the Mono SDK, which can be changed to use the full SDK. However, the web player can not be changed, limiting access to System.web which is needed by Jayrock.</p>

<p>While running ./configure it would output the following error message:</p>

<blockquote><p>configure: error: Please install mono version 1.1.17 or later</p></blockquote>

<p>I did confirm my mono version:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mono JIT compiler version 2.6.7</p></blockquote>

<p>After using the Googles for a bit ran accross a post a link to download a zip file that had the DLL already built: Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/litjson/files/litjson/0.5.0/litjson-0.5.0-bin.zip/download">litjson-0.5.0-bin.zip (224.2 KB)</a></p>

<p>With some code changes JsonMapper seems to be working and I&#8217;m able to parse the JSON.</p>

<blockquote><p>List<LessonProgress> listOfLessonProgress = JsonMapper.ToObject&lt;List<LessonProgress>>(www.text);</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>What I was working with:</strong></p>

<p>Unity3D version: 3.3.0f4</p>

<p>MonoDevelop version: 2.4.2</p>

<p>OS: OSX (10.6.7)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A coworker and I attened <a href="http://mobilexconference.com/lexington2011/">MobileX</a> in Lexington Ky this past week. It was a great time!
Since we are a new smaller company we thought we should promote the company, but how? After much discussion the idea of having a simple shirt won (time/money constraints). The front had the company name while the back had a logo. It was pretty good, but we felt it needed just a bit more.</p>

<p>Since this was a mobile conference we figured there should be something somewhat mobile about theshirts. What about a QR Code? It seemed pretty simple and a fine way to go. The QR code was added to the logo on the back side of the shirt.</p>

<p>DeveloperTown Logo:

<p>This QR code is pointing to developertown.com/mobile. At the time we didn&#8217;t know what to put on the site. The night before, with the help of an amazing graphic designer at DeveloperTown, we put something together. It needed to be something that would help break the ice and help introduce us to people. Below is what we came up with:
<img class="center" src="/images/24844060-photo.png" width="500" height="374" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<p>I think we got a few laughs and quite a few people talking to us from such a silly simple idea.

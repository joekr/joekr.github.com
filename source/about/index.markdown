I'm a passionate software developer, that loves to explore and learn new things. Currently a Software Engineer at [The Jockey Club Technology Services](http://www.tjctechnology.com/home.asp) working in iOS and Java Spring mainly. I also consult from time to time for [Remora Studio](http://www.remorastudio.com/) using Ruby On Rails.

I enjoy what I do and hope to continue exploring and honing my craft. There is nothing better than creating things that can help change the world.

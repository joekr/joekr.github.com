With Posterous closing down April 30th (thanks Twitter) I felt it was time to move my site elsewhere. I opted for Github Pages using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) (designed for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)). 

So far I'm very happy with it. Everything is very customizable, setup was super simple and fast, and deployment was a snap! I say that with the caveat that some ruby/rails development experience might be necessary. Was Posterous easier than all of this? Sure, but I'm a developer. I should get to know all this stuff since I have never really used it before. 

There is a better reason I chose to use this setup over something like Posthaven, Square, Wordpress, etc. I hope in the future there will be a project for me to flex my Octopress/Jekyll muscles. After all learning new (to me) things is always useful.

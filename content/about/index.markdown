Using my powers for good
-------------
![Joe being attacked by a storm trooper](/images/profile_pic_144.png)

I'm a passionate software developer, that loves to explore and learn new things. Currently a Software Engineer at [Foxio](http://fox.io) working in iOS, Android, Go, JS and Ruby mainly.

I enjoy what I do and hope to continue exploring and honing my craft. There is nothing better than creating things that can help change the world.

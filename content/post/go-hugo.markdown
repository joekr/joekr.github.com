I've been working a lot with [Go](https://golang.org/) lately, and clearly I don't blog at all. My last post was 2014. So I decided to upgrade my blog to use [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) in hopes to get my involved once more.

Mainly this is a test to make sure my deployment works well. Because let's be honest, if deployment becomes a pain I won't do it.

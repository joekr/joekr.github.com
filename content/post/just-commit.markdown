I'm adopting the motto Just Commit. I'm tired of over thinking. It makes things move slower, and can sometimes be crippling.
A good friend of my tends to tell me "just commit" when refering to code. If something breaks, fix it. If something isn't optimal yet, it can be optimized later, but just commit. This, starting a few days ago, is my new life motto.

So from now now I will be just commiting!
